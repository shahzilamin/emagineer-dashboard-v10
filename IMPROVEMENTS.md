## Design Principles

1. **30-second test** - CEO should understand business health in 30 seconds
2. **Click for depth** - Summary first, details on demand
3. **No vanity metrics** - Every number must drive a decision
4. **Mobile-first** - Works on phone during meetings
5. **Fast** - Sub-second interactions
